# GhostBind  
_A process disguising & stealth execution framework._  

### What It Does:  
- **Executes commands & scripts without appearing in process lists**  
- **Masks processes as trusted system daemons**  
- **Removes execution traces from logs & memory**  
- **Ensures forensic analysis cannot detect hidden operations**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A process that does not exist  
Is a process that cannot be controlled."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Start a hidden execution:  
   ```bash
   ./ghostbind --run ./hidden_script.sh
2. Disguise a process as a system service:
   ./ghostbind --mask /bin/bash
3. Wipe execution traces after completion:
   ./ghostbind --clean
